# FVAE

The code is modified from https://github.com/x7jeon8gi/FactorVAE, which is someone else's attempt to replicate "Duan et al: Use Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to reduce the financial returns to a set of non-linear factors".

First, please run HPML.ipynb. After the model is trained, please run Backtest.ipynb to see financial backtest results. The WandB link is https://wandb.ai/ilovewatermelon111/FactorVAE
